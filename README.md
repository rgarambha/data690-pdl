# data690-pdl
This repo contains results and/or models which are trained for the Homework of Data690:PDL 

This repo will be made private after I am done with this subject.

Limitation of Google colab:
- limited GPU runtime
- one cell at a time ( no concurrency)
- session inactivity after sometime
- can lose your progress if you disconnect mistakenly
- can't store saved models permanently
- no way to restore the output

I have a decent system which can train more than 2 models simultaneously. So, I train them on my system save results using torch.save(), I am maintainig this repo to keep it organized and then importing into colab to show plots and results.  

Future update: adding encryption so that public repo can't be misused.
